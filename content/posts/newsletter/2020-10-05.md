## Other

The owner of the [joinxmpp.org](https://joinxmpp.org) domain is lacking time. They wrote a short description of the original goals and say they are now looking for somebody motivated to take on the project.

## Extensions and specifications

Read more about the [standards process](https://xmpp.org/about/standards-process.html).

@wurstsalat3000 I left the previous structure to make new entries simpler as always! Thank you, this is a great support!

### Updated

- Version 2.11.0 of [XEP-0004](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0004.html) (Data Forms)
  - Further clarify the presence requirements for the type attribute on fields.

### Last Call

Last calls are issued once everyone seems satisfied with the current XEP status. After the Council decides whether the XEP seems ready, the XMPP Editor issues a Last Call for comments. The feedbacks gathered during the Last Call help improving the XEP before returning it to the Council for advancement to Draft.

- [XEP-0411](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0411.html) (Bookmarks Conversion)

### Proposed Extensions

The XEP development process starts by writing up an idea and submitting it to the XMPP Editor. Within two weeks, the Council decides whether to accept this proposal as an Experimental XEP.

- [XMPP Compliance Suites 2021](https://xmpp.org/extensions/inbox/cs-2021.html)
  - This document defines XMPP application categories for different use cases (Core, Web, IM, and Mobile), and specifies the required XEPs that client and server software needs to implement for compliance with the use cases.

## Help us to build the newsletter

We started drafting every new issue in the [XSF Github repository](https://github.com/xsf/xmpp.org/pulls) and we are 
always happy to welcome contributors. Do not hesitate to join the discussion in our [Comm-Team group chat (MUC)](xmpp:commteam@muc.xmpp.org?join) 
and thereby help us sustain this as a community effort. 

You have a project and write about it? Please consider sharing your news or events here, and promote it to a large audience! 
Even if you can only spend a few minutes, these would already be helpful!

Tasks which need to be done on a regular basis are for example:

- Aggregation of news in the XMPP universe
- Short formulation of news and events
- Summary of the monthly communication on extensions (XEP)
- Review of the newsletter draft
- Preparation for media images
- Translations: especially German and Spanish
